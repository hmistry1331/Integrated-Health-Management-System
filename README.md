Objective: 
The Integrated Health Management System (IHMS) is a centralized 
platform designed to streamline healthcare services by efficiently 
managing patient data, medical histories, doctor consultations, and 
personalized health recommendations. The system focuses not only 
on diagnosing and treating diseases but also on promoting overall 
well-being through food and lifestyle recommendations.  

A classic scenario of how the system works: 
When a patient visits the Integrated Health Management System (IHMS), they 
are first asked to provide basic health-related details such as sugar level, blood 
pressure, and other vital signs. The system then evaluates this data against 
standard health parameters. If the patient's readings deviate from the normal 
range, such as having high blood pressure, the system gives them the option to 
either consult a doctor or receive recommendations for medications and a 
suitable diet to manage their condition. 

However, if the patient has a pre-existing illness and their current health data 
indicates a potential risk, the system automatically schedules an appointment 
with a doctor without requiring confirmation. This ensures that patients with 
known medical conditions receive immediate medical attention, reducing the 
chances of complications. By integrating preventive care, real-time health 
monitoring, and personalized treatment, IHMS provides an efficient and 
proactive approach to healthcare management.
